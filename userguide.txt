Official User Instructions

For Windows Operating System:

Install the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

You will need various packages to run the program 

Open Windows power shell, use 
py -m pip 
to install pip, which will allow you to install these required modules, then use

py -m pip install __package name____

for the packages:
-	numpy 
-	matplotlib
-	scipy

Next, you need to generate the executable using Anaconda, or compiling the code using CMake. Anaconda is 
recommended as the simpler and quicker option. 

Using Anaconda:

Open the Anaconda Prompt (included when Anaconda is downloaded) and use commands:

conda create -n impact
source activate impact # or conda activate impact
conda install -c conda-forge impact-t

Your executable will be found in C:\Users\__username__\anaconda3\envs\impact, under the name "ImpactTexe"

You may choose move ImpactTexe to the same directory as the GUI, but this is not necessary. Simply specify
the absolute path of the executable on the GUI.

Once you have your executable, you are ready to run ImpactT. 

Open your Anaconda Prompt (the executable cannot be run using Windows Powershell) and navigate to the /GUI directory.

Use command:

activate impact

if you are not already in the "impact" environment

Run the GUI with the command:

py ImpactGUI.py




For Linux:

Install the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

You will need various packages to run the program 

Open the terminal, use 
python -m pip

or, if "python" is not recognized

python3 -m pip 

to install pip, which will allow you to install these required modules, then use

python -m pip install __package name____

or (must match the one you installed pip with)

python3 -m pip install __package name____

for the packages:
-	numpy 
-	matplotlib
-	scipy

You may choose move ImpactTexe to the same directory as the GUI, but this is not necessary. Simply specify
the absolute path of the executable on the GUI.

Once you have your executable, you are ready to run ImpactT. 

Navigate to the /GUI directory, and use command:

python ImpactGUI.py

or

python3 ImpactGUI.py


For NERSC:

Clone the repository onto your own file library.

All python packages needed are already included in NERSC, simply activate them using the command:

module load python

Next, you need to generate the executable using Anaconda, or compiling the code using CMake. Anaconda is 
recommended as the simpler and quicker option. 

Anaconda is already included in the loaded Python modules, so simply use commands:

conda create -n impact
conda activate impact
conda install -c conda-forge impact-t

Your executable will be found in /global/homes/i/__your_username__/.conda/envs/impact/bin, 
under the name "ImpactTexe"

You may choose move ImpactTexe to the same directory as the GUI, but this is not necessary. Simply specify
the absolute path of the executable on the GUI.

Once you have your executable, you are ready to run ImpactT. 

Navigate to the /GUI directory, and use command:

python ImpactGUI.py

For Mac:

Please note that various issues have been found with running IMPACT-T on Mac that are not present on other
operating systems. Known issues include, but are not limited to:

- Modules necessary for running IMPACT-T cannot be correctly installed when running Python 3.10 or above, 
as of current, only Python 3.9 can potentially IMPACT-T on Mac without error

When successfully download, potential issues include:

- pre-processing causing "IndexOutofBounds" error
- the run process randomly repeats or skips over certain numbers

Install latest version of python through the official website

Errors:
When trying to install numpy
It is suggested that using python 3.8 may work
However, a different scientist suggested on Github that the python packages used for this program will not be supported on Mac, due to the use of Fortran
