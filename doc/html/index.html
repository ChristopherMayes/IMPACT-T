<div class="textblock"><h2>IMPACT-T: A 3D Parallel Particle Tracking Code in Time Domain </h2>
<p>IMPACT-T is a fully three-dimensional program to track relativistic charged particles taking into account space charge forces, short-range longitudinal and transverse wakefields, coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) wakefield in accelerators. IMPACT-T code can run on both massive parallel supercomputers and single processor computers such as Windows PC, Mac, and Linux system. It is one of the few codes used in the photoinjector community that has a parallel implementation, making it very useful for high statistics simulations of beam halos and beam diagnostics. It has a comprehensive set of beamline elements, and furthermore allows arbitrary overlap of their fields, which gives the IMPACT-T a capability to model both the standing wave structure and traveling wave structure. It includes mean-field space-charge solvers based on an integrated Green function to efficiently and accurately treat beams with large aspect ratio, and a shifted Green function to efficiently treat image charge effects of a cathode. It is also unique in its inclusion of energy binning in the space-charge calculation to model beams with large energy spread. It also has a direct N-body solver to calculate stochastic space-charge forces. IMPACT-T has a flexible data structure that allows particles to be stored in containers with common characteristics; for photoinjector simulations the containers represent multiple slices, but in other applications they could correspond, e.g., to particles of different species. Together, all these features make IMPACT-T a powerful and versatile tool for modeling beams in photoinjectors and other systems.</p>

<li>The current version of the code is for serial single processor computer with Fortran90 compiler. To run the code on a parall computer with MPI, the user has to comment out the line "use mpistub" in <a class="el" href="_input_8f90.html">Contrl/Input.f90</a>, <a class="el" href="_data_8f90.html">DataStruct/Data.f90</a>, <a class="el" href="_pgrid_8f90.html">DataStruct/Pgrid.f90</a>, <a class="el" href="_phys_const_8f90.html">DataStruct/PhysConst.f90</a>, and <a class="el" href="_timer_8f90.html">Func/Timer.f90</a>. The user also has to remove the mpif.h file under the Appl, Control, DataStruct, and Func directories. The user also has to modify the Makefile to remove the mpistub.o inside the file and to use the appropriate parallel F90 compiler such as mpif90.</li>
<li>The phaseOpt.py is used to find the driven phase of a RF cavity with initial design phase. This code needs to be modified for each input ImpactT.in file in order to use it correctly.</li>
<li>The subroutines in <a class="el" href="_f_f_t_8f90.html">FFT.f90</a>: realft, four1, and sinft, can be replaced with functions from the Numerical Recipe or some equavilent 1D FFT functions. </li>
